# demo-dynamics
The goals for this Unity project are to create multiple (and hopefully) modular game features that I have seen done before and personally interest me. Most of these features involve doing / creating things in nearly infinite possible / unpredictable ways and therefor need to be handled while the game is running rather than done preemptively. THIS IS NOT A FULL GAME PROJECT and therefore does not require time or commitment, it can be dropped and picked up at any time.

Features for project in order of current priority:
1.	Ability to slice objects in near infinite ways (Ex: Metal Gear Rising Revengence).
2.	Ability to blowtorch a wall / object and cut variously shaped holes in it (Ex: Maverick from Rainbow Six Siege)
3.	Ability to shoot walls create bullet holes that can be seen through (Ex: Rainbow Six Siege)
4.	Ability to walk through mud, snow, and so on to while leaving trails / footprints behind. (Ex: Read Dead Redemption 2).
5.	Ability to get Mud / Snow / Blood stuck on other characters and objects when they come into contact (Ex: Red Dead Redemption and any game that killing enemies gets blood on the player and their weapons)
6.	Ability to trample / cut grass (EX: similar to the above two features).

Other features with lower priority / possible higher complexity:
1.	Physics for fluids (Ex: Water automatically flowing to another location when a hole is dug below it or if it its container start to overflow)
2.	Do a more in-depth dive into lighting, render pipelines, and other features to improve the look of a game.
3.	More in-depth look at animation, and making it react more to the environment (Ex: having the character put their arms up near walls and adjusting their legs when walking on objects / uneven terrain. Make enemies react more accurately to be bumping into or being attacked by the player).
4.	More destructible environment physics. Such as structures collapsing when there is not longer enough support for them (Ex: Teardown, 7 Days to Die, etc.)

More ideas and features that we want to test can be added later at any time:
